<h1>Picture Palette Plotter</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Made by: Petar Partaloski (193181)</h4>
<br>
<p>This is a simple program that I made, inspired by a few reddit posts where I saw the color palette of a<br>
picture being represented as a color palette, so I wanted to give it my try on this specific problem<br>
where I experienced pictures for the first time and tried representing all of these colors in a barplot<br>
<br>
<br>
Latest update focused on making the app so that you get only the colors that differ from each other more than 22 units
of value in the 3D space, since colors are basically a dot in the 3D space.
<br>
The reason I chose the unit 22 is nothing but the test cases I did, the value 22 seemed the most appropriate and gave<br>
me the best results in return, you can change it by going into the file (main.py) and just changing the first file

To make sure your program will run, you'll need to first make sure you have python installed<br>
</p>
<h3>Then do the commands:</h3><br>
<ul>
	<li>pip install pandas</li>
	<li>pip install matplotlib</li>
</ul>

<h3>To run the program, after all of the above has been satisfied<br><strong>double click the run.bat file - if on Windows</strong></h3>
