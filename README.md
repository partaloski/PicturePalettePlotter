<h1>Picture Palette Plotter</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Made by: Petar Partaloski (193181)</h4>
<br>
<p>This is a simple program that I made, inspired by a few reddit posts where I saw the color palette of a<br>
picture being represented as a color palette, so I wanted to give it my try on this specific problem<br>
where I experienced pictures for the first time and tried representing all of these colors in a barplot<br>
<br>
<br>
Previous update was focused on making the app so that you get only the colors that differ from each other,<br>
so that there is a difference between colors, I chose that in this app, the colors have to differentiate at least 22 units<br>
to then be added to the list of colours, else, we count the appearances for the duplicate in the original.<br>
<br>
The reason I chose the unit 22 is nothing but the test cases I did, the value 22 seemed the most appropriate and gave<br>
me the best results in return, you can change it by going into the file (main.py) and just changing the first file
<br>
The latest app focuses on introducing an actual UI, that makes this program usable by anyone, the instructions are clear<br>
And you should be able to run it on every version of Windows that has Python installed.
