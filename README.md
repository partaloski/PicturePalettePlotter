<h1>Picture Palette Plotter</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Made by: Petar Partaloski (193181)</h4>
<br>
<p>This is a simple program that I made, inspired by a few reddit posts where I saw the color palette of a<br>
picture being represented as a color palette, so I wanted to give it my try on this specific problem<br>
where I experienced pictures for the first time and tried representing all of these colors in a barplot<br>
